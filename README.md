@[TOC](Data and script usage instructions)
This repository provides the data of the WCNC 2025 paper (Modeling Packet Loss of Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Networks) and the associated Matlab script; Follow these steps to quickly reproduce the experiments in the article. 
### Experimental data download
Data can be obtained from the following link
[ [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1VVBqKwlwSYV30KQsDOk8DQ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1VVBqKwlwSYV30KQsDOk8DQ) Extract code: ikag].
In the downloaded data, 'loss' is the packet loss data and 'arrivals' is the packet loss arrival interval data.
### MAP Toolbox (Butools) download
The numerical script uses Butools for MAP modeling. Please download the butools's Matlab package from [https://github.com/ghorvath78/butools](https://github.com/ghorvath78/butools) and unzip it into the script folder.
### Experimental replication procedure
#### Step1
The packet loss interval data is selected as the input of the data generated by the GAN model to obtain GAN_data.
#### Step2
The data to be used from the downloaded data folder, the Butools toolbox folder, and the GAN-generated data (GAN_data) are placed in the folder. Run *modeling.mlx* in Matlab to replicate the experiments covered in the paper.
